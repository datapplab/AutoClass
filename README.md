# AutoClass

## AutoClass: Composite Deep Neural Network for In-Depth Cleaning of Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data
AutoClass is a deep neural network-based tool for scRNA-Seq data imputation. It consists of an autoencoder and a classifier, 
the classifier branch is added to make sure useful information of signal is sufficiently retained.
