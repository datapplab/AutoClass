## AutoClass: Composite Deep Neural Network for In-Depth Cleaning of Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data
### Overview

AutoClass is a neural network-based tool for scRNA-Seq data imputation. It consists of an autoencoder and a classifier, 
the classifier branch is needed for noise removal and signal retention. When cell classes are unknown, virtual class labels are generated by pre-clustering. The architecture of the model can be described with the following image:
